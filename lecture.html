					<h1 class="align-left">Data Science</h1>
					<p class="textAlign">Data science is an inter-disciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms and systems to extract knowledge and insights from structured and unstructured data. Data science is related to data mining and big data.</p>
					<p class="textAlign"><a href="https://rdaye.tistory.com/category/DATA%20SCIENCE" class="textAlign";>>> Data Science Lecture Room <<</a></p>
					
					
					<h1 class="align-left">Machine Learning</h1>
					<p class="textAlign">Machine learning (ML) is the scientific study of algorithms and statistical models that computer systems use to perform a specific task without using explicit instructions, relying on patterns and inference instead. It is seen as a subset of artificial intelligence. Machine learning algorithms build a mathematical model based on sample data, known as "training data", in order to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to perform the task. Machine learning algorithms are used in a wide variety of applications, such as email filtering and computer vision, where it is difficult or infeasible to develop a conventional algorithm for effectively performing the task.</p>

					<h1 class="align-left">Deep Learning</h1>
					<p class="textAlign">Deep learning (also known as deep structured learning or differential programming) is part of a broader family of machine learning methods based on artificial neural networks with representation learning. Learning can be supervised, semi-supervised or unsupervised.</p>

					<h1 class="align-left">Python</h1>
					<p class="textAlign">Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language. Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant whitespace. Its language constructs and object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and large-scale projects.</p>

					<h1 class="align-left">Java</h1>
					<p class="textAlign">Java is a general-purpose programming language that is class-based, object-oriented, and designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is intended to let application developers write once, run anywhere, meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation. Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying computer architecture. The syntax of Java is similar to C and C++, but it has fewer low-level facilities than either of them. As of 2019, Java was one of the most popular programming languages in use according to GitHub, particularly for client-server web applications, with a reported 9 million developers.</p>

					<h1 class="align-left">Algorithm for Interview</h1>
					<p class="textAlign">A Coding interview, programming interview or Microsoft interview is a technical problem-based job interview technique pioneered by Microsoft to assess potential employees. Microsoft's interview technique was innovative, and subsequently developed by other large technology companies including Amazon, Facebook, and Google. Coding interviews test candidates' technical knowledge, coding ability, problem solving skills, and creativity, typically on a whiteboard. Candidates usually have a degree in computer science, information science, computer engineering or electrical engineering, and are asked to solve programming problems, algorithms, puzzles.</p>
