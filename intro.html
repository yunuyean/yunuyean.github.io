					<p class="textAlign">I'm a cowboy programmer. When I was in middle and high school, I used to help my father raise cows a lot. At that time, I was very interested in computer programming, and while attending high school, I was selected to enter the entrepreneurship education institute by the Korean Intellectual Property Office and Pohang University of Science and Technology and studied business for two years. I helped my father raise cows, and I thought about how to improve the environment through software. So, I tried to come up with ideas based on the business knowledge I learned at POSTECH. As a result, I decided to develop software that allows breeders to easily and conveniently record and calculate cow information. Based on this idea, I joined Cafe about cow and tried to analyze the users' needs, including what functions the user needs in the software. I developed software based on customersâ€™ needs and business theories, and repeated it for 4 months. when the software was stabilized, I sent a letter to the head of the Rural Development Administration in South Korea, writing down about the software, and he sent the head and developer of the National Institute of Animal Science to my school.</p>
					
					<p class="textAlign">I talked with them, and I realized once again that it was very important to analyze the customer's needs and develop the software from the user's perspective in order to make good software. I'm telling you this story because I want to actively show you the passion that I had in developing software and the spirit of challenge that I could try. Also, I am currently developing this software for the development of software in rural areas. I've studied not only the programming field, but also the business. Since I studied business and management at Pohang University of Science and Technology for two years in high school, I have business knowledge as well as software. The reason that I've studied business is that I know it's no longer the age of programming alone to make good software. In order to develop good software, we need to have a close analysis of the software market situation, and we need to be able to discover the customer's needs. Therefore, I believe that the importance of business knowledge and competence will increase in software developers.</p>
